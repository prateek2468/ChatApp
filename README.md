# ChatApp

Welcome to the readme for ChatApp, an ongoing project aimed at creating a simple chat application in Java. In its initial stages, the app only allows users to join and communicate from a single computer. However, we're actively working to expand its capabilities to enable users to connect from different computers and use various databases. This document will guide you through the project's current status, installation, and our roadmap for future development.

## Current Status
The current version of ChatApp (v0.1) provides basic functionality for users on a single computer to send and receive messages within the application. The user interface is command-line based and features a simple text-based interaction. Users can run the app on their local machine and communicate with each other using the terminal.

## Installation
To run ChatApp on your computer, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/prateek2468/JavaFX-Chat-App.git
```
Naviagate to main launching folder :
```
cd app/src/main/java/json/a8
```
Run the Application: Run the compiled Java program to start the application:
```
java MainActivity.java
```

## Roadmap for Future Development
We have an exciting roadmap for the future development of ChatApp. Here's what we're currently working on and planning to add to the application:

## Multi-Computer Support
Our next major goal is to enable users to connect to the chat application from different computers. This involves implementing networking functionality using Java's socket programming capabilities. Users will be able to join a common chat room and exchange messages regardless of their physical location.

## Database Integration
We're also planning to integrate a database into the application to store chat history, user profiles, and other relevant data. This will allow users to access their previous conversations even after they've closed the application. We're considering using technologies like JDBC to interact with the database from within the Java application.

## User Authentication
As we expand the application to support connections from different computers, we'll implement user authentication mechanisms to ensure secure access. This will involve creating user accounts, managing passwords, and enforcing access controls.

## Graphical User Interface (GUI)
In addition to the command-line interface, we're considering developing a graphical user interface (GUI) for the ChatApp. This will provide a more user-friendly and visually appealing way for users to interact with the application.

## Continuous Improvement
Throughout the development process, we'll continuously improve the codebase, enhance error handling, and optimize the application's performance for a smoother user experience.

Thank you for your interest in ChatApp! We're excited about the potential of this project and look forward to delivering more features and functionalities in the near future. Stay tuned for updates!
